## v0.6.0


## v0.5.0


## v0.4.0

## v0.3.0

Move the font files to a github archive and download them at compile-time
to avoid Hex's package limits.

## v0.2.0

First version available on Hex.

Main items on the road map:

  1. Support more plot types
  2. Add support for a better kernel density estimation (KDE) algorithm,
     ideally something based on the diffusion-based algorithm in Botev 2010
  3. Define a data protocol that objects can implement if they can be used
     as sources of data for plots (this would allow us to support Explorer
     data frames, lists, arrays and other sources of data)

## v0.1.0

First public version.
